This repository is the final result of project "Cryptofolio", an applied project for Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC) Master's Degree in Computer Science. More information [here](http://androide.lip6.fr/?q=node/384) (in french).
The overall goal of the platform is to provide cryptocurrencies investor with a decision aid on how to create a diversified portfolio to maximize returns and minimize risks.
Several optimization algorithms are proposed, from traditional high-frequency live trading to state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Structure of the repository:
* [Django](Django): Source code of our platform, implemented with Python Django. Part of the code dedicated to portfolio optimization is [here](Django/projet/PGPortfolio).
* [Literature](Literature): most of the literature we based our theoretical choices on is available on this folder.
* [Report](Rapport): Summary of the study of the algorithms and development steps, in particular: [the final report](Rapport/Rapport.pdf) and [its code](Rapport/Rapport.tex) files (french).
* [Other material](Other material): various deprecated material used during the development of the platform, including: tryouts with R Shiny, unused datasets, figures and notres from tryouts with algorithms.

## Access the platform
The landing page of the platform is available [here](https://michaeltrazzi.wixsite.com/cryptoptimisation) and the application [here](https://cryptoptimize.herokuapp.com/).
